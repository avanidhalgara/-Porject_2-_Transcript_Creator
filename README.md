# Pioneer Academy : Transcript Creator from Student Database. 

Small-scale academic institutes /  non-profit organizations who run academic programs, often manually maintain their database or store it in excel. While creating transcript for their learners, they need enter data from excel. It’s a tedious and repetitive task. 

## Goal

Allow admin users to have mechanisms where they can maintain students’ databases accurately and able to create well formatted transcripts for their beneficiaries(learners) based on completed exams. 

## User Stories

As an admin/user, I am able to maintain my students’ databases accurately with all necessary information
As an admin/user, I am able to add new student info, view student data, and update students’ marks
As an admin/ user, I am able to create official transcripts for my students based on completed exams.

Graphic functionality can be incorporated to track progress
an option to print transcript in pdf format
